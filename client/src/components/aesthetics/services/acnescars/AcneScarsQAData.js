    Q: "When will I see results after acne scar treatment?",
    A: [
      "As collagen and elastin continue building in your skin, you notice a drastic improvement with acne scars. You should start seeing optimal results about a month after your treatment. Because acne scars affect the deep layers of your skin, you probably need several treatments to achieve the best results. A package of three to seven sessions — each about a month apart —  with the Icon laser is most common, but your needs may vary. While the entire process takes months, you should start noticing an improvement every week along the way."

    Q: "Does laser acne scar treatment hurt?",
    A: [
      "Not at all. It’s a laser system, so it’s typical to feel some warmth, but you shouldn’t be in any pain. If you have acne scars in sensitive areas, like under your chin, you might experience some discomfort during your treatment. It won’t last more than a few seconds though. If you’re worried about pain or are having discomfort during your Icon laser treatment, talk with your practitioner. He or she can numb your skin with a topical numbing cream to make treatments more pleasant for you."

    Q: "What is Botox?",
    A: [
      "Botox is made from botulinum toxin, a substance that inhibits your neuromuscular activity. With this type of treatment, areas of your face that are sagging, droopy, or wrinkled perk up and volumize — giving you a more youthful-looking appearance.",
      "Results from a Botox treatment last a few months, but are noticeable almost immediately, which makes this an ideal procedure when you want a fast cosmetic enhancement that isn’t invasive or painful. Botox can also improve the way light reflects on the contour of your face."

    Q: "What happens at a Botox procedure?",
    A: [
      "Before getting Botox, your doctor meets with you to discuss your goals and assess your skin type and problem areas.",
      "After cleansing and prepping the targeted treatment area, your doctor or aesthetician injects the Botox solution into just under your skin. They might also lightly massage the treatment area to help distribute the solution evenly and to achieve your desired results.",
      "Botox is convenient because you can return to your routine quickly after the appointment. However, your doctor may advise you to avoid risky activities, like contact sports or sun exposure, for a few days.",
      "Although you shouldn’t experience any pain, there might be slight tenderness and swelling at the injection site. With a proper skincare routine, this side effect should subside quickly, and you can fully enjoy your new skin and youthful look within a couple of days."

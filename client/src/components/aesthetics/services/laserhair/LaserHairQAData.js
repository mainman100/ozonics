    Q: "What is laser hair removal?",
    A: [
      "Laser hair removal harnesses the heat energy of a laser to target and destroy hair follicles, preventing future hair growth. Laser hair removal is becoming more common as the technology improves, making the treatments more effective and pain-free for most hair colors. You can have laser hair removal on any part of your body from your face to your toes.",
      "During her lifetime, a woman who shaves spend an average of 58 days and over $10,000 on this never-ending grooming chore. Regular waxing costs even more. Laser hair removal is an FDA-approved method of removing hair and reducing growth patterns, which leads to long-term results."

    Q: "Does laser hair removal work on all skin tones and hair colors?",
    A: [
      "Yes, it is effective on all skin tones and most hair colors. Laser hair removal is not as effective on white hair and some tones of red hair. The laser works by targeting the melanin found in the hair follicle. Very light hair may not have sufficient melanin for the laser to target."

    Q: "How many sessions will I need?",
    A: [
      "You may notice a reduction in your body hair after just one session. However, most patients have a series of at least six sessions, spaced 4 weeks apart, to cover the three stages of hair growth and achieve the maximum results. Results vary from patient to patient, so you may need more sessions to achieve your desired results."

    Q: "Is the hair removal permanent?",
    A: [
      "After several treatments, your laser hair removal results should be permanent, however it is still possible that some regrowth will occur after your series of treatments is complete. Sometimes hormonal changes — like those that occur during pregnancy — can trigger hair regrowth. Nevertheless, you can always book touch up sessions if you feel it’s necessary. Most patients experience significant reductions in hair growth with smooth, hair-free skin."

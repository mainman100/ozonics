    Q: "What is the purpose of body contouring?",
    A: [
      "Body contouring is used to eliminate small pockets of fat normally located on the inside of the thighs, under the arms, along the sides of the abdomen, and across the lower back. The SculpSure laser can target these areas exclusively, eliminating the fat and adding definition. The contouring process can define muscle groups and provide long lasting results.",
      "Precision Aesthetics often use the SculpSure laser to help patients who’ve lost an excessive amount of weight, yet need to fine tune the areas that still contain small pockets of fat. It's also an ideal tool for women who have gained a small amount of weight in these areas and haven't been able to lose it through normal methods such as exercise and dieting."

    Q: "How does the SculpSure Laser work?",
    A: [
      "The SculpSure laser is a unique tool that helps medical professionals target specific pockets of fat that are located on areas of the body that aren’t normally affected by most weight loss measures. These areas can include:",
      "\u23FA the abdomen",
      "\u23FA lower back",
      "\u23FA under arms",
      "\u23FA along the sides",
      "\u23FA the hips",
      "\u23FA inside the thighs",
      "The laser is a precision tool and is used to not just move fat cells, but destroy them in the process.",
      "The SculpSure laser works by sending light waves into the fat deposits and heating the fat cells to approximately 45 degrees Celsius. Heating the cells to this temperature damages them to the point where they start to break down. As time passes, the body takes over the process and either reabsorbs them or breaks them down completely, eliminating them from the body as waste."

    Q: "Are body contouring results permanent?",
    A: [
      "The results of the SculpSure procedure are permanent. The technique does not move the fat from place to place. Instead, it destroys the cells, by damaging them through a thermogenic process. Once the fat cells begin to break down, results can be seen in the patient's appearance. The initial results are apparent in as little as three to four weeks.",
      "In order for the patient to see permanent results, they must wait for approximately three months. The final results are fully noticeable after 12 weeks. The SculpSure laser produces long lasting, almost permanent results if the patient controls their weight and maintains a healthy lifestyle."

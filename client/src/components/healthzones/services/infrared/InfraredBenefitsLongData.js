      "As part of a sauna skin therapy program, infrared saunas help restore skin to a youthful appearance. The near infrared wavelengths are the most effective wavelengths for healing the epidermis and dermis layers of the skin. Near infrared treatments stimulate collagen production to reduce wrinkles and improve overall skin tone. Far infrared wavelengths target deeper down, removing toxins that can have a negative impact on your skin."

      "The Full Spectrum infrared heating technology used in our Infrared Saunas has the ability to heal wounds faster and minimize scarring through the use of near infrared LEDs. No other sauna can offer these health benefits.  Scientific research has concluded that near infrared therapy greatly enhances the skin’s healing process by promoting faster cell regeneration and human tissue growth. Human cell growth increases to repair wounds and prevent infection."

    benefit: "Muscle Recovery, Immune Defense",
    benefits: [
      "Near, mid, and far infrared heat therapy aid in cell health, muscle recovery and overall immunity defense.

      "It does this by enhancing the flow characteristics of blood as a liquid. This enables more of the oxygen carrying hemoglobin to reach the capillaries where ultimately the cells will receive more of the oxygen they require. Many patients with chronic inflammatory conditions have impaired circulation. This effect is particularly relevant to people with:",

    text:
      "ATP (adenosine triphosphate) transports chemical energy within cells for metabolism. Ozone acts on red blood cells by increasing ATP and 2,3-DGP due to the reduction of Hb-O2 affinity. 2,3-DGP is an organic phosphate in red blood cells that alters the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. It lowers hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen and by extension, facilitates the release of O2 to body tissues. Improved oxygenation is relevant to the control of many conditions including:ons have impaired circulation. This effect is particularly relevant to people with:",

    text:
      "Ozone assists in regulating the immune system. It does this by activating the membranes of white cells that causes them to produce immune related messenger molecules called cytokines, such as Interferon and Interleukins, colony stimulating factor, and TNF-alpha. When your immune system is over active, as in auto immune diaeases (eg ulcerative colitis) ozone can calm it down. When it is under active (eg chronic infections), ozone can stimulate the immune system.",

    title: "Stimulates uptake of oxygen",
    text:
      "Ozone stimulates increased uptake of oxygen by stimulating the enzyme diphosphoglycerate (DPG). DPG enables the release of oxygen from the hemoglobin molecule so that it can be taken up into the cell. In the absence of an adequate amount of DPG, our cells become starved for oxygen. This is a common problem in diabetics.",
